    <h2>What is Volleyball?</h2>
      <h3>Volleyball is a team sport, in which two teams (consisting of 6 players each) are on different sides of the court to try to score a point by using
        their forearms or arms to hit a ball over a net and make the ball touch the ground of opponents playing area.</h3>

    <h2>History of Volleyball</h2>
    <p>The sport of volleyball was created by William G. Morgan, who was the director of physical education at the Young Man’s Christian Association (YMCA) in
      Holyoke, Massachusetts. Morgan created the sport in 1895 and the original name was Mintonette. Ideas from handball and tennis were used to play volleyball.
      The net was 6ft and 6in high and the court was 25ft x 50ft. There was no limit to how many players were allowed on the court. In each match, there were 9
      “innings” and each team were allowed 3 serves in each inning. There were also not limits to how many ball contacts before sending the ball over.</p>
