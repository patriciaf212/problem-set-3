    <h1>Indoor Volleyball vs. Beach Volleyball</h1>
    <h3> There are several differences between beach volleyball and indoor volleyball </h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Beach Volleyball is palyed in sand and indoor volleyball is played in a gymnasium.</li>
      <li>There are different sized courts. The beach volleyball court is smaller than an indoor volleyball court.
        A beach volleyball court is 16m x 8m. An indoor volleyball court is  18m x 9m.</li>
      <li>Different types of balls are used. Beach volleyballs are softer, lighter, and a tab bit bigger. Indoor
        volleyballs are made of leather and are heavier</li>
      <li>In beach volleyball, there are only 2 players on each side of the court. In indoor volleyball,
        there are 6 players on each side of the court</li>
      <li> Because there are only 2 players in beach volleyball, there are no specific positions,
        However, players must know all of the skills: hit, pass, and block. In indoor volleyball,
        there are each player has a specfic position.</li>
